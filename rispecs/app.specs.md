# COAIA Memory Application Specifications (RISE Framework)

> Complete specification for rebuilding COAIA Memory from scratch as an MCP server implementing structural tension charts for creative-oriented AI assistants.

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Framework**: RISE (Reverse-engineer, Intent-extract, Specify, Export)  
**Target Audience**: LLMs, developers, and AI systems needing to understand creative-oriented memory management

## 🎯 OVERVIEW: What COAIA Memory Enables

### Creative Intent
COAIA Memory enables users to **manifest desired outcomes** through structural tension dynamics rather than problem-solving approaches. Users can create charts that maintain honest awareness of current reality, clarify what they want to create, and track advancing patterns toward those outcomes.

### Key Distinction from Traditional Tools
- **NOT Problem-Solving**: Doesn't focus on "fixing", "eliminating", or "solving" problems
- **NOT Task Management**: Doesn't operate as a to-do list or project tracker
- **IS Creative Manifestation**: Helps users apply Robert Fritz's structural tension principles to advance toward desired outcomes naturally

### Structural Tension Principle
The system creates productive tension between:
- **Current Reality**: Honest assessment of where you are now
- **Desired Outcome**: Clear vision of what you want to create
- **Structural Tension**: The unresolved gap that naturally seeks resolution through advancement

This tension generates natural progression toward outcomes when properly structured.

## 🎯 CREATIVE ADVANCEMENT SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Creating a Web Application
**User Intent**: "I want to create a modern web app that helps teams collaborate"

**Current Structural Reality**: "I have JavaScript experience, built 2 small projects, never deployed to production"

**Natural Progression Steps**:
1. User creates master chart with desired outcome and current reality
2. System auto-distributes due dates across initial action steps
3. User breaks down "Build API" into telescoped sub-chart
4. Sub-chart has own structural tension (current reality: "can write endpoints", desired: "robust production API")
5. User completes API action step, which becomes fact in master chart current reality
6. Master chart now shows "API complete" as existing condition, advancing tension toward larger outcome
7. Next action steps now make sense from new structural position

**Supporting Features**:
- Chart creation with creative orientation validation
- Automatic due date distribution maintaining overall timeline
- Telescoping enabling detail without losing context
- Progress tracking showing advancement from structural position

### Scenario 2: Learning Complex Skill
**User Intent**: "I want to become proficient in Python web development"

**Current Structural Reality**: "I know basic Python syntax, never used Django or any framework"

**Natural Progression Steps**:
1. Master chart establishes tension between syntax knowledge and web development proficiency
2. Action steps identified: Learn Django, Build tutorial project, Deploy live application
3. User telescopes "Learn Django" into sub-chart
4. Sub-chart current reality: "Installed Django, read intro docs"
5. Sub-chart desired outcome: "Understand Django's MTL structure"
6. User makes progress on MTV understanding, records observation
7. Completion of Django learning becomes part of master current reality
8. Master chart now shows "Django knowledge gained" as existing fact
9. Next actions (building project, deployment) are now adjacent progression steps

**Supporting Features**:
- Honest current reality prevents false readiness assumptions
- Telescoping enables deep learning on specific topics
- Progress updates track advancement without forcing completion
- Hierarchy shows master vision maintained while zooming to details

### Scenario 3: Creative Project Development
**User Intent**: "I want to build an innovative narrative experience"

**Current Structural Reality**: "I have storytelling ideas, no experience with interactive media tools, haven't written code for 3 years"

**Natural Progression Steps**:
1. Master chart establishes creative tension toward narrative innovation
2. Action steps: Learn interactive medium, Research story structure, Prototype experience
3. User telescopes "Learn interactive medium" maintaining structural creativity focus
4. Progress observations recorded showing learning advancement without marking complete
5. User updates current reality with "Researched Twine and Ink engines, leaning toward Ink"
6. This changes structural dynamic for next action steps naturally
7. User continues iterative advancement, each progress updating structural position

**Supporting Features**:
- Creative orientation maintained throughout (not "fix storytelling problems")
- Progress updates enable detailed tracking without completion pressure

## 📈 ADVANCING PATTERN VS OSCILLATING PATTERN

### Advancing Pattern (Structural Tension Dynamics)
- Each action completion adds to current reality facts
- New facts create new structural position
- Next steps naturally flow from new position
- Momentum builds - each step makes next easier
- Direction is forward toward desired outcome

**System Design for Advancement**:
- Completed actions explicitly flow into current reality
- Progress observable in changed structural position
- Charts show clear advancement metrics
- Telescoping maintains vision while enabling detail

### Oscillating Pattern (Problem-Solving Approach)
- Focus on "eliminating" problems
- Creates back-and-forth movement (fix something, it breaks elsewhere)
- No fundamental structural change
- Energy consumed maintaining status quo
- No forward momentum

**What System Prevents**:
- Rejects problem-solving language in desired outcomes
- Requires honest current reality (prevents false readiness)
- Tracks advancement not just activity
- Prevents completion without reality integration

4. Check progress: Verify progress reflects advancement
5. List charts: Verify hierarchy shows complete/advancing relationship
6. Observe: Each completion visibly changes structural position toward goal

## 🎓 CREATIVE ORIENTATION VALIDATION CHECKLIST

For each feature implementation, verify:

- ✅ Does this help users CREATE something specific?
- ✅ Does this maintain structural tension appropriately?
- ✅ Does completion advance toward outcome or just complete task?
- ✅ Would an advancing pattern naturally emerge from this?
- ✅ Would oscillating patterns be prevented by this design?
- ✅ Is the methodology teaching built into the tool?
