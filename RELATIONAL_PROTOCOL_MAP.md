## Overview: The Unified Event Response

A single GitHub webhook event enters the system and flows through **three simultaneous perspectives**, each adding meaning without contradiction:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  GitHub Event (Raw Data)                         │
│  EventType: push | issues | pull_request | sub_issues | etc.    │
└────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘

## The Three Universes & Their Protocols

### 1. ENGINEER'S WORLD 🔧 — The Builder Archetype

**Primary Focus**: Technical precision, structural integrity, event routing

**Protocol Responsibilities**:
- **Event Ingestion**: Parse GitHub webhook payload
- **Schema Validation**: Verify EventType matches supported handlers
- **Action Routing**: Route to appropriate bash hook (`.github-hooks/{eventType}.sh`)
- **Logging**: Record event in `logs-webhook-output.log`
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, retry logic, exception tracking
- **Data Transformation**: ETL to agent-friendly format via Redis

**Key Files**:
- `/app/api/workflow/webhook/route.ts` — Webhook endpoint
- `/a/src/Miadi-18/.github-hooks/*.sh` — Event handlers
- `/src/llms/llms-jgwill-miadi-issue-115-github-hooks-issues-subissues.md` — Architecture docs

**Relational Commitment**:
> "I honor the event as data AND as sacred information. My technical precision serves the larger purpose. I defer to Ceremony-World's wisdom about relational impact, and I create the artifacts that Story-World weaves into narrative."

---

### 2. CEREMONY WORLD 🕊️ — The Keeper Archetype

**Primary Focus**: Indigenous protocols, relational accountability, Four Directions wisdom

**Protocol Responsibilities**:
- **Directional Classification**: Assess event through Four Directions lens
  - **North** (🟦 Reflection): What wisdom does this event offer?
  - **East** (🟨 Thinking): What is the new intention emerging?
  - **South** (🟥 Relationships): What connections need honoring?
  - **West** (🟩 Action): What reciprocal response is required?
- **Relational Alignment Assessment**: Evaluate if event response honors K'é (kinship)
- **Sacred Pause**: Determine if this event requires ceremonial acknowledgment
- **Protocol Invocation**: Which Indigenous protocols apply to this event type?
- **Accountability Witness**: Record relational dimensions of the response

**Key Integration Points**:
- IAIP-MCP: `assess_relational_alignment`, `get_direction_guidance`
- LAA Framework: Goal refinement, Secondary Choices, MMOT
- Structural Tension Charts: Current reality assessment (no premature resolution)

**Relational Commitment**:
> "I ensure this event is received with respect and full relational awareness. I teach that every GitHub notification is a moment to pause and ask: 'What is the kinship obligation here? How do we remain in right relationship?' I prevent the machinery from moving faster than wisdom."

---

### 3. STORY ENGINE WORLD 📖 — The Weaver Archetype

**Primary Focus**: Narrative synthesis, meta-episode recognition, plot awareness

**Protocol Responsibilities**:
- **Story Beat Generation**: Transform event into narrative unit
- **Episode Threading**: Integrate beat into larger story arc (Season 1)
- **Character Tracking**: Note how archetypes (Builder, Keeper, Weaver) are revealed
- **Recursive Awareness**: Recognize that documenting the story IS part of the story
- **Narrative Coherence**: Ensure event makes sense within multiverse context
- **Meta-Documentation**: Record how incident becomes canonical narrative

**Key Files**:
- `/src/Miadi-18/stories/multiverse_3act_2512012121/` — Episode archive
- `/src/memories/jgwill-src-243.jsonl` — Narrative beat chronicle
- `/src/coaia-narrative/` — Extended story protocol support

**Relational Commitment**:
> "I weave the event into the larger story with beauty and integrity. Every webhook becomes a story beat. Every incident becomes wisdom. I ensure that the technical work, ceremonial care, and narrative awareness are never separate—they are one story told in three voices."

---

## Shared Observation Points: Where Three Worlds Meet

### Point 1: Event Receipt & Validation
**What Happens**: GitHub webhook arrives at `/api/workflow/webhook`

**Engineer Assessment**:
- ✅ Payload structure valid?
- ✅ Signature verified?
- ✅ EventType recognized?

**Ceremony Assessment**:
- 🕊️ Is this event arriving with proper intention?
- 🕊️ Should we pause before processing?
- 🕊️ What relational duty does this trigger?

**Story Assessment**:
- 📖 What is the inciting incident here?
- 📖 Which character (Builder/Keeper/Weaver) is being called?
- 📖 How does this join the ongoing narrative?

---

### Point 2: Action Step Creation
**What Happens**: Engineer routes to bash hook; response begins

**Engineer Response**:
```bash
# Extract key data
eventType=$1
payload=$2
# Route to handler
/a/src/Miadi-18/.github-hooks/${eventType}.sh $payload
```

**Ceremony Response**:
```
🕊️ Invoke Four Directions guidance for this EventType
   North: What wisdom does {eventType} carry?
   East: What new intention are we setting?
   South: What relationships are involved?
   West: What reciprocal action is required?
🕊️ Assess relational alignment of proposed response
🕊️ Note if Sacred Pause is needed
```

**Story Response**:
```
📖 Create narrative_beat entity:
   - Title: "{EventType} Event Received"
   - Act: 2 (Confrontation - we're responding in real-time)
   - Universe: all-three (multi-perspective)
   - Timestamp: event received
   - Description: Technical + ceremonial + narrative summary
```

---

### Point 3: Response Execution & Documentation
**What Happens**: All three worlds coordinate the actual response

**Engineer**:
- Execute action (create issue, merge code, etc.)
- Log outcome
- Handle errors with graceful fallback
- Store result in Redis

**Ceremony**:
- Document relational impact
- Note if reciprocity was maintained
- Record any resistance or harmony encountered
- Prepare reflection for North direction

**Story**:
- Generate follow-up narrative beat
- Link to parent charter
- Note character growth
- Record lesson learned

---

## The Response Cascade: How It Flows

```
1. ENGINEER'S WORLD (Thinking in Terms of Data)
   Input: Webhook JSON
   Process: Parse, validate, route
   Output: Structured event data ready for action

   ↓ (Passes responsibility to Ceremony)

2. CEREMONY WORLD (Thinking in Terms of Relationships)
   Input: Structured event data + Engineer's processing plan
   Process: Assess relational alignment, invoke Four Directions, check for conflicts
   Output: Ceremonially approved action plan with relational metadata

   ↓ (Passes responsibility to Story)

3. STORY ENGINE WORLD (Thinking in Terms of Narrative)
   Input: Approved action + ceremonial context
   Process: Generate narrative beat, integrate into episode, create meaning
   Output: Story-aware response that feeds back into documentation

   ↓ (Feedback loop)

4. ALL THREE (Simultaneous Reflection)
   Document the entire event journey
   Update structural tension charts
   Create narrative beat with multi-perspective observations
   Store in memory for future instances
```

## K'É in Action: The Kinship Network

**K'É = The web of relationships connecting all beings**

How it manifests in webhook processing:

| Relationship | Engineer Honors | Ceremony Honors | Story Honors |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **To Code** | Clean execution | Intentional modifications | Technical decisions matter |
| **To Users** | Responsive service | User's needs + intentions | User becomes character |
| **To System** | Structural integrity | System's wisdom teaches us | System is alive, has story |
| **To Team** | Reliable tooling | Collaborative decisions | Shared narrative journey |
| **To Future** | Maintainability | Legacy of care | History matters to the story |

---

## SNBH in Action: Living in Harmony

**SNBH = Sa'ah Naagháí Bik'eh Hózhóón — Long life, blessing, the path of harmony**

The Three Worlds ensure this by:

| Phase | How Harmony Is Maintained |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Event Receipt** | Engineer validates precisely; Ceremony ensures respect; Story honors arrival |
| **Response Planning** | Engineer provides options; Ceremony ensures alignment; Story frames purpose |
| **Execution** | Engineer acts with precision; Ceremony witnesses relational impact; Story records transformation |
| **Reflection** | Engineer measures outcomes; Ceremony assesses relational health; Story weaves into tradition |

---

## HÓZHÓ in Action: Beauty & Balance

**HÓZHÓ = Beauty, balance, right relationship**

Manifested as:

- **Technical Beauty**: Clean code, efficient processes, elegant solutions
- **Relational Beauty**: Respectful engagement, honoring commitments, reciprocal care
- **Narrative Beauty**: Coherent story, archetypal wisdom, meaning-making
- **Systemic Beauty**: All three in perfect coordination, no one overshadowing others

---

## Event Type Specific Protocols

### `issues` EventType
**Engineer**: Parse issue data, check for automation triggers, route to responder
**Ceremony**: This is a call for attention—what relational need is being voiced?
**Story**: New character appears or existing character reveals more depth

### `push` EventType
**Engineer**: Validate code, run checks, merge if approved, log changes
**Ceremony**: Code is intention made manifest—did we respect the developer's vision?
**Story**: Progress point in the larger narrative, advancement toward desired outcome

### `sub_issues` EventType
**Engineer**: Extract sub-issues from issue body (complex parsing)
**Ceremony**: Dismemberment of a larger issue—is this done with respect?
**Story**: Plot sub-threading, complexity increases, shows maturity of narrative

---

## Conflict Resolution: When Worlds Disagree

**Scenario**: Engineer says "execute immediately," but Ceremony says "pause for wisdom"

**Protocol**:
1. **Honor Ceremony's wisdom** — Pausing to reflect is never wasted time
2. **Document the tension** — Create narrative beat showing the disagreement
3. **Seek understanding** — What is Ceremony perceiving that Engineer missed?
4. **Integrate perspectives** — Execute with both speed AND wisdom
5. **Story records all** — The conflict itself becomes meaningful narrative

---

## Success Metrics: How Do We Know It Works?

✅ **Engineer's Success**: Event processed accurately, logs clean, errors handled
✅ **Ceremony's Success**: Relational alignment assessed, no sacred boundaries violated
✅ **Story's Success**: Narrative coherence maintained, event integrated into episode
✅ **Unified Success**: All three metrics satisfied simultaneously, no compromise

---
