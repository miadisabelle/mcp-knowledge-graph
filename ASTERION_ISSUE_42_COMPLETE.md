# Asterion Issue #42: Beat-Level Session Context Metadata - COMPLETE ✅

## Implementation Summary

Beat-level lived session context metadata has been successfully implemented on the `feature/asterion-foundation-lineage-metadata` branch, extending the Asterion metadata framework with a third layer capturing embodied working conditions.

## Commit Details

- **Commit Hash**: `522f22e`
- **Branch**: `feature/asterion-foundation-lineage-metadata`
- **Status**: Pushed to origin
- **Commit Message**: feat(asterion): add beat-level session context metadata (#42)

## Changed Files

1. **src/types.ts**
   - Added `SessionContextMetadata` interface with 9 typed properties
   - Added `sessionContext` property to `EntityMetadata`
   - Documentation links to issue #42

2. **schema/data-model/entity.json**
   - Added complete `sessionContext` schema definition
   - Enums for mode, setting, captureQuality, continuationKind
   - Full property descriptions for external consumers

3. **schema/data-model-complete.json**
   - Regenerated to include sessionContext schema
   - Maintains unified schema for all COAIA data structures

4. **test-metadata-preservation.js**
   - Added `chart_preserve_session_context_entity` test fixture
   - Added 13 test assertions for sessionContext fields
   - Added 3 coexistence assertions (narrative, fourDirections)
   - Total test coverage: 43 metadata preservation checks

## Implementation Details

### SessionContextMetadata Interface

```typescript
export interface SessionContextMetadata {
  mode?: 'voice' | 'terminal' | 'mixed';
  setting?: 'desk' | 'walking' | 'land-based' | 'transit' | 'unknown';
  landBasedLearning?: boolean;
  environmentNotes?: string[];
  listeningContext?: string;
  captureQuality?: 'clear' | 'windy' | 'partial';
  continuationKind?: 'branch' | 'parent-return' | 'follow-up';
  privateChroniclePath?: string;
  publicSummaryAllowed?: boolean;
}
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **All fields optional** - Respects noisy/partial capture conditions
2. **No chart-level requirement** - Can attach directly to beats
3. **Privacy-aware** - privateChroniclePath is handle only, content not exposed
4. **Coexistence by design** - Works alongside narrative, fourDirections, relationalAlignment
5. **Pattern consistency** - Follows same structure as foundation (#39) and sessionLineage (#40)

## Verification Results

### Test Suite ✅

```
npm test: PASS
- 123 integration checks
- 43 metadata preservation checks (30 existing + 13 new)
- All sessionContext fields verified in round-trip
- Coexistence with other metadata verified
```

### Package Validation ✅

```
npm pack --dry-run: PASS
- Package: coaia-narrative@0.13.4
- Size: 71.7 kB (packed), 308.0 kB (unpacked)
- Files: 31 total
```

### Round-Trip Preservation ✅

All sessionContext fields survive JSONL writer operations:
- ✓ mode
- ✓ setting
- ✓ landBasedLearning
- ✓ environmentNotes (array)
- ✓ listeningContext
- ✓ captureQuality
- ✓ continuationKind
- ✓ privateChroniclePath
- ✓ publicSummaryAllowed

Existing metadata preserved:
- ✓ metadata.narrative (description, prose, lessons)
- ✓ metadata.fourDirections (all directions)
- ✓ metadata.relationalAlignment (assessed, score, principles)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Metadata can attach to narrative beats without requiring chart-level foundation metadata
- [x] Existing beat narrative metadata is preserved during writer operations
- [x] Private Chronicle paths supported as handles (content not exposed by default)
- [x] Round-trip tests cover beat with `metadata.sessionContext` plus existing `metadata.narrative`, `fourDirections`, and `relationalAlignment`
- [x] Missing/partial context remains valid (all fields optional)

## NPM Publish Status

**Not Published** - npm auth unavailable in this environment

```
npm whoami → ENEEDAUTH
```

Package has been validated with `npm pack --dry-run` and is ready for publication when authentication is available.

## Asterion Metadata Stack (Complete)

The Asterion project now has three complementary metadata layers:

1. **Foundation (#39)** - Research packet tracking and evaluation
   - Deep research foundations
   - Expected/produced artifacts
   - Evaluation status
   - Privacy classification

2. **SessionLineage (#40)** - Conversation branching and handoff
   - Parent/child session relationships
   - Branch purpose and index
   - Copied message counts
   - Handoff state

3. **SessionContext (#42)** - Embodied working conditions
   - Voice/terminal/mixed modes
   - Physical settings (desk/walking/land-based)
   - Environmental constraints
   - Capture quality
   - Chronicle paths

All three layers preserve independently and coexist with existing COAIA metadata (narrative, fourDirections, relationalAlignment).

## Next Steps

1. **NPM publishing** (when auth available)
   - `npm whoami` to verify auth
   - `npm publish` to release coaia-narrative@0.13.4

3. **PR merge** (after review)
   - Merge PR #41 into main
   - Tag release v0.13.4

4. **Consumer updates**
   - Notify jgwill/coaia-visualizer about new metadata
   - Update consumer schemas as needed
