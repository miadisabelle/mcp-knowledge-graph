/**
 * COAIA Narrative — the store read contract.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR
 *
 * This package owns the writes. Anything that renders a chart store was, until now,
 * re-deriving the store's shape by hand — entity-kind strings, the `${chartId}_chart`
 * naming scheme, which metadata key holds the MMOT trail. That knowledge living in two
 * places is not a style problem: when it drifts, a renderer does not break, it quietly
 * renders LESS. A chart holding real work looks identical to an empty one.
 *
 * HOW IT AVOIDS BEING THE THING IT WARNS ABOUT
 *
 * The first draft of this module re-implemented record classification by hand, and a
 * review measured it returning 73 entities where the writer's own parser returned 76 —
 * it dropped the legacy `type:"narrative_beat"` dialect and reported the losses as
 * corruption. Duplication relocated rather than removed.
 *
 * So classification is NOT defined here. `./jsonl-records.js` holds the single
 * definition, and both the writer (jsonl-preservation.ts) and this contract import it.
 * What this module adds on top is the two things the writer's parser genuinely does not
 * offer a renderer: per-line TOLERANCE (parseJsonlMemory throws on one bad line, which
 * is correct for a writer and fatal for a surface), and the selectors/naming below.
 *
 * THREE RULES THIS MODULE KEEPS
 *
 * 1. Zero I/O. No `fs`, no `process`, no network. Callers own reading; this owns shape.
 * 2. Never imports the server. The package's `main` IS the MCP bootstrap — importing the
 *    package root starts a stdio server — which is why this lives behind its own subpath.
 * 3. Tolerant by construction, honest about what it skipped.

 * suggests a foreign or damaged line. But a store truncated by something OTHER than this
